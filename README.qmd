# quadagree 

[![CRAN_Status_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/quadagree)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=quadagree) [![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/JonasMoss/quadagree/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JonasMoss/quadagree/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml) [![Project Status: Active -- The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

An `R` package for calculating and doing inference the quadratically weighted multi-rater measures of agreement. Fleiss' kappa, Cohen's kappa (Conger's kappa), and the Brennan-Prediger coefficient. Has support for missing values using the methods of Moss and van Oest (work in progress). ***This package is work in progress and has no stable API! Expect breaking changes.***

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library("quadagree")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width = "750px", dpi = 200)
```

## Installation

The package is not available on `CRAN` yet, so use the following command from inside `R`:

```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JonasMoss/quadagree")
```

## Usage

Call the `library` function and load the data of Zapf et al. (2016):

```{r prepare, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library("quadagree")
head(dat.zapf2016)
```

Then calculate an asymptotically distribution-free confidence interval for $\kappa$,

```{r}
fleissci(dat.zapf2016)
```

You can also calculate confidence intervals for Conger's kappa (Cohen's kappa) and the Brenna-Prediger coefficient.

```{r}
#| cache: true
congerci(dat.zapf2016)
```

## Support for missing values
The inferential methods have support for missing values, using pairwise available information in the biased sample covariance matrix. We use the asymptotic method of van Praag (1985). 

The data from Klein (2018) contains missing values.

```{r}
#| cache: true
head(dat.klein2018)
```

The estimates returned by `congerci`, `quadagree` and `bpci` are consistent.
```{r}
#| cache: true
congerci(dat.klein2018)
```

## Supported inferential techniques

`quadagree` supports three basic asymptotic confidence interval constructions. The asymptotically distribution-free interval, the pseudo-elliptical interval, and the normal method.

| Method       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `adf`        | The asymptotic distribution free method. The method is asymptotically correct, but has poor small-sample performance.                                                                                                           |
| `elliptical` | The elliptical or pseudo-elliptical kurtosis correction. Uses the unbiased sample estimator of the common kurtosis (Joanes, 1998). Has better small-sample performance than `adf` and `normal` if the kurtosis is large and $n$ is small. |
| `normal`     | Assumes normality of $X$. This method is not recommended since it yields too short confidence intervals when the excess kurtosis of $X$ is larger than $0$.                                                                               |

In addition, you may transform the intervals using one of four transforms:

1.  The [Fisher transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_transformation), or $\kappa\mapsto \operatorname{artanh}(\kappa)$. Famously used in inference for the correlation coefficient.
2.  The $\log$ transform, where $\kappa \mapsto \log(1-\kappa)$. This is an asymptotic pivot under the elliptical model with parallel items.
3.  The identity transform. The default option.
4.  The [$\arcsin$ transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_functions). This transform might fail when $n$ is small, as negative values for $\hat{\kappa}$ is possible, but $\arcsin$ do not accept them,

The option `bootstrap` does studentized bootstrapping Efron, B. (1987) with `n_reps` repetitions. If `bootstrap = FALSE`, an ordinary normal approximation will be used. The studentized bootstrap intervals are is a second-order correct, so its confidence intervals will be better than the normal approximation when $n$ is sufficiently large.

## Data on wide form
Some agreement data is recorded on *wide form* instead of *long form*. Here each row contains all the possible ratings of an item along with the total number of ratings for that item. The data of Fleiss (1971) is on this form

```{r}
head(dat.fleiss1971)
```

Provided the raters are exchangeable in the sense that the ratings are conditionally independent given the item, consistent inference for the Fleiss' kappa and the Brennan--Prediger coefficient is possible using `fleiss_aggr` and `bp_aggr`.  
```{r}
fleiss_aggr_ci(dat.fleiss1971)
```

## Similar software
There are several `R` packages that calculate agreement coefficients, most notably `irrCAC`.
