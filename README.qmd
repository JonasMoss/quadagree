[![CRAN_Status_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/fleissci)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fleissci) [![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/JonasMoss/fleissci/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JonasMoss/fleissci/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml) [![Project Status: Active -- The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

An `R` package for calculating and doing inference with the quadratically weighted multi-rater Fleiss' kappa, Cohen's kappa, and Conger's kappa. Has support for missing values using the methods of Moss and van Oest (work in progress). ***This package is work in progress and has no stable API! Expect breaking changes.***

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library("fleissci")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width = "750px", dpi = 200)
```

## Installation

The package is not available on `CRAN` yet, so use the following command from inside `R`:

```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JonasMoss/fleissci")
```

## Usage

Call the `library` function and load the data of Zapf et al. (2016):

```{r prepare, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library("fleissci")
head(dat.zapf2016)
```

Then calculate an asymptotically distribution-free confidence interval for $\kappa$,

```{r}
fleissci(dat.zapf2016)
```

You can also calculate confidence intervals for Conger's kappa (Cohen's kappa).

```{r}
#| cache: true
congerci(dat.zapf2016)
```

## Support for missing values
The inferential methods have support for missing values, using pairwise available information in the biased sample covariance matrix. We use the asymptotic method of van Praag (1985).

## Supported inferential techniques

`fleissci` supports three basic asymptotic confidence interval constructions. The asymptotically distribution-free interval, the pseudo-elliptical interval, and the normal method.

| Method       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `adf`        | The asymptotic distribution free method. The method is asymptotically correct, but has poor small-sample performance.                                                                                                           |
| `elliptical` | The elliptical or pseudo-elliptical kurtosis correction. Uses the unbiased sample estimator of the common kurtosis (Joanes, 1998). Has better small-sample performance than `adf` and `normal` if the kurtosis is large and $n$ is small. |
| `normal`     | Assumes normality of $X$. This method is not recommended since it yields too short confidence intervals when the excess kurtosis of $X$ is larger than $0$.                                                                               |

In addition, you may transform the intervals using one of four transforms:

1.  The [Fisher transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_transformation), or $\kappa\mapsto \operatorname{artanh}(\kappa)$. Famously used in inference for the correlation coefficient.
2.  The $\log$ transform, where $\kappa \mapsto \log(1-\kappa)$. This is an asymptotic pivot under the elliptical model with parallel items.
3.  The identity transform. The default option.
4.  The [$\arcsin$ transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_functions). This transform might fail when $n$ is small, as negative values for $\hat{\kappa}$ is possible, but $\arcsin$ do not accept them,

The option `bootstrap` does studentized bootstrapping Efron, B. (1987) with `n_reps` repetitions. If `bootstrap = FALSE`, an ordinary normal approximation will be used. The studentized bootstrap intervals are is a second-order correct, so its confidence intervals will be better than the normal approximation when $n$ is sufficiently large.

## Similar software
There are several `R` packages that calculate agreement coefficients, most notably `irrCAC`.
