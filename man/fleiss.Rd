\title{Calculate the quadratic Fleiss' kappa and Conger's (Cohen's) kappa}
\usage{
fleiss(x)

conger(x)

cohen(x)

conger_pop(mu, sigma)

cohen_pop(mu, sigma)

fleiss_pop(mu, sigma)

fleiss_aggr(x, values = seq(ncol(x)))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Input data on wide form. Columns are raters, items are ratings.
Missing values are allowed, and should be encoded as \code{NA}s.}

\item{mu}{Population vector of means.}

\item{sigma}{Population covariance matrix.}

\item{values}{to attach to each column on the Fleiss form data.
Defaults to \code{1:C}, where \code{C} is the number of categories. Only used
in \code{fleiss_aggr}.}
}
\value{
Sample / population quadratically weighted Fleiss' or Conger's kappa.
}
\description{
Estimate a quadratically weighted kappa with potentially missing data using
least squares, or calculate its population value. \code{conger} and \code{cohen} are
aliases. See \code{\link[=fleissci]{fleissci()}} and \code{\link[=cohenci]{cohenci()}} for confidence intervals.
}
\details{
Conger's kappa is a multi-rater generalization of Cohen's kappa.
All functions in this package work for multiple raters, so functions
starting with \code{cohen} or \code{conger} are aliases. The quadratically weighted
Cohen's kappa is also known as Lin's (1989) concordance coefficient.

The only difference between Cohen's kappa and Fleiss' kappa lies on how they
measure disagreement due to chance. Here Fleiss' marginalizes the rating
distribution across raters, essentially assuming there is no difference in
the rating distribution across raters, while Cohen's kappa does not.
There is a large literature comparing Fleiss' kappa to Cohen's kappa,
and there is no consensus on which to prefer.

The functions \code{cohen_pop}, \code{conger_pop}, and \code{fleiss_pop} calculate the
population values of the kappas using the mean and covariance of the
rating distributions. The derivation of the covariance and mean
formulation can be found in (Moss and van Oest, work in progress.)

The functions \code{cohen}, \code{conger}, and \code{fleiss} estimate the kappas using least
squares. This method uses the biased sample covariance estimator, which
agrees with the literature on agreement coefficients in the case of two
raters. In the case of missing data, the pairwise available data is used,
employing the option \code{use = "pairwise.complete.obs"} in \code{\link[stats:cor]{stats::cov()}}.
