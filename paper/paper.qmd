### Summary

When measuring agreement between raters on an ordinal scale, the most popular methods are the quadratically weighted agreement coefficients. Three popular options are the quadratically weighted Fleiss' kappa, Cohen's kappa (also known as Conger's kappa), and the Brennan--Prediger coefficient. This package implements estimators and inferential methods for these coefficient. Details about the methods can be found in Moss and van Oest (2023) and Moss (2023). The main contribution of this package is consistent estimation and inference for the quadratic agreement coefficients with missing data and a method for calculating the novel kind of Brennan-Prediger coefficient introduced by Moss (2023).

This package supports data on wide form and long form for Fleiss' kappa and the Brennan-Prediger coefficient, and long form for Cohen's kappa. In addition, if the data is on long form, estimation and inference with missing data and continuous is possible. Since inference with complete data is already possible using available packages such as `irrCAC`, we focus on missing data primarily. In addition, we support fast studentized bootstrap, 

Klein (2018) provides a data set of $5$ raters with some missing ratings. To calculate Fleiss' kappa for this data, call `fleissci`. The functions `bpci` and `cohenci` can be used to calculte the Brennan-Prediger coefficient and Cohen's kappa.

fleissci(dat.klein2018)
```

Possible options for the `ci` functions include the `type` argument, where one may assume the ratings are elliptically or normally distributed for possibly improved performance. Moreover, setting `bootstrap = TRUE` runs a studentized bootstrap with `n_reps` repetitions. Since the studentized bootstrap is second-order consistent, one would expect it to have better coverage when $n$ is sufficiently large.

Our methods provide consistent estimators of the agreement coefficient, but existing packages such as `irrCAC` does not. The following provides and example.
